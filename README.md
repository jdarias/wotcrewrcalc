# WOT Crew Skill Reset Calculator

[![WOT Crew Skill Reset Preview & Calculator](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ePXIdlbFkH4/hqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePXIdlbFkH4)

This is a small calculator that will show you the effect of a skill reset using any of the options in World of Tanks(TM) (gold, 20K creds or 200 Gold) on a crew member.

You simply tell it how many skills your crewman has, and the partial skill percentage of the one in training.

Then you choose a reset option, and the app will show you the effect.

Keep in mind that your crewmember must be at 100% of his/her main qualification.

This way you can know how much do you need to train before achieving a safe spot that conserves all your 100% skills after the reset.

This is the first program I write and I'll probably improve upon it as I learn more about C++. Thank you for your interest, I hope it's useful to you.

This program is free software but not open source. Use it at your own risk. (your handheld calculator may be more dangerous to use than this, So don't sue me if you or your pet die because of using it).

(Obviously not affiliated in any way to Wargaming and World of Tanks).

## Updates

**04/27/2017**

Program will now remain active if you make mistakes when entering skills and percentage.

It will also allow you to restart the calculation without exiting.

I wonÂ´t use UPX anymore to avoid AV false positives, so file size has increased.
